		<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Kevin Anderson</span> and I am a current senior at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
		<p>I am a Bioinformatics major with a minor in History.</p>
		<p>I love science and technology, obviously. I choose to study bioinformatics because I simply did not want to do wet lab research. I have been behind a computer all of my life, whether that be browsing the web or playing videogames, and even building computers. I figured answering scientific questions while just using a computer would be my dream job! I was also infatuated with all of the unknowns that bioinformatics has to offer. Being a fairly new field, there is so much information that is left to be interperated!</p>
