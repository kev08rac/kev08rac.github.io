<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>I love science and technology, obviously. I choose to study bioinformatics because I simply did not want to do wet lab research. I have been behind a computer all of my life, whether that be browsing the web or playing videogames, and even building computers. I figured answering scientific questions while just using a computer would be my dream job! I was also infatuated with all of the unknowns that bioinformatics has to offer. Being a fairly new field, there is so much information that is left to be interperated!</p>
